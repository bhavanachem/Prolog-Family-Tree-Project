# Prolog-Family-Tree-Project
This project demonstrates the use of Prolog for modeling family relationships. The program defines a family tree with parent-child relationships and rules to determine grandparents, great-grandparents, and even great-great-grandparents. It also includes gender information for individuals in the family tree.
