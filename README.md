# Prolog-Family-Tree-Project
This project demonstrates the use of Prolog for modeling family relationships. The program defines a family tree with parent-child relationships and rules to determine grandparents, great-grandparents, and even great-great-grandparents. It also includes gender information for individuals in the family tree. It also defines Ancestor relationship in a recursive chain.

# Additional Recursive Logic

The code also implements general-purpose recursive operations and problem-solving techniques.

## 1. Membership in a List (mem)

Checks if an element is a member of a list.

## 2. Last Element in a List (lst)

Finds the last element of a list.

## 3. Append Two Lists (app)

Appends two lists together.

## 4. Select an Element from a List (sel)

Selects an element from a list and returns the remaining list.

## 5. Tower of Hanoi (hanoi)

Solves the Tower of Hanoi problem for N disks and returns the sequence of moves.

## 6. Factorial (fac)

Computes the factorial of a number.

## 7. Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Solver (solve)

Attempts to solve a SEND + MORE = MONEY cryptarithmetic puzzle.
